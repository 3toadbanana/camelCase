## Team Goals
For the final project, we want to make a functioning, aesthetic website that showcases nutritional data. In the bigger picture, we want to get a clear understanding of real-world programming while honing key skills such as team collaboration, multi-language coding, meaningful documentation, and applied ethical reasoning.

## Team Strengths

### Overall Strengths
Our group has members who have previously worked with Flask, including a member experienced in building and deploying a dataset-backed website. We have good communication, with clearly agreed-upon modes of contact and meeting times. Below are some individual strengths we bring to the group.

### Individual Strengths
- **Adit:** Has worked with Flask before, with experiences in multiple languages. As a prospective CS Major, he is motivated and engaged with this project.
- **David:** POSC major. Strong writing background. Familiar with applied ethics in real-world situations. Although relatively less experienced in CS, this factor can allow for him to have a closer consumer perspective for the final product. Experienced with keeping meeting notes, organizing meetings, and streamlining/delegating work within a group.
- **Beshir:** As a CS major, I have worked on CS projects and have experience in multiple languages and using GitHub. I enjoy these types of projects, which keeps me motivated for the task.
- **Taha:** Have worked in CS-related team projects for website development, familiar with several languages, passionate about CS, good communication, and motivating other members.

## Capitalizing on Strengths

### Delegation Strategy
We will delegate tasks efficiently and effectively. For example:
- Members experienced with HTML will handle HTML components.
- Members proficient with Flask will manage Flask components.

While we do not plan for a rotating role system, we are open to reassigning roles upon consensus based on project needs.

### Roles
- **David:** Sets meeting agenda and schedules extra meeting times.
- **Adit:**
- **Beshir:** Completes assigned parts of the project on time and attends meetings.
- **Taha:** Delivers work and attends meetings punctually.

## Team Expectations

The primary mode of general communication will be through group text, with emails (calendar invites) as the mode to set up meetings. We will update each other on the status of our delegated work, checking the group text at least once every weekday. The meetings will be once a week on Wednesday 8pm for 1 hour on Zoom.  If a teammate misses four meetings, including being late for more than 30 minutes, we will contact Jean as necessary. 
As a team we believe respectful communication looks like a give and take between listening and speaking. We will listen actively with each other, and wait our turn to give our feedback. When we disagree, we will understand that it is part of the process of creating something better. If conversations get too heated, we will take a couple minutes off the zoom call to cool down. Satisfactory participation to us is broad, as direct coding is not the only method of contributing meaningfully. We believe feedback, active listening, and research are all meaningful contributions team members could make. As for time contributions, we expect each member to contribute at least 10 hours outside of class to follow this project per week (or the equivalent amount of work done). We are happy to help out if a member is struggling, but it is up to the responsibility of the member to reach out and communicate to the rest of the team. If there is a member that can not meet these work contribution standards, we will give 2 warnings, then proceed to contacting Jean. 
We will make decisions through consensus, and if there is a disagreement that can not be resolved through just convincing, we will go with majority rule. 
A general rule for delegation will be efficiency and proficiency. We have members who are already familiar with Flask, HTML, and other things necessary for this project. We will delegate the tasks accordingly to make sure we keep our workflow quick and efficient. For tasks that nobody is familiar with, we will first go with volunteers, then into rock paper scissors.
