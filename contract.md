Carl's Nutrition

## Team Goals
For the final project, we want to make a functioning, aesthetic website that showcases Bon Appetit’s, Carleton College’s food vendor, nutritional and allergy data. In the bigger picture, we want to get a clear understanding of real-world programming while honing key skills such as team collaboration, multi-language coding, meaningful documentation, and applied ethical reasoning.

## Team Strengths

### Overall Strengths
Our group has members who have previously worked with Flask, including a member experienced in building and deploying a dataset-backed website. We have good communication, with clearly agreed-upon modes of contact and meeting times. Below are some individual strengths we bring to the group.

### Individual Strengths
- **Adit:** Has worked with Flask before, with experiences in multiple languages. As a prospective CS Major, he is motivated and engaged with this project.
- **David:** POSC major. Strong writing background. Familiar with applied ethics in real-world situations. Although relatively less experienced in CS, this factor can allow for him to have a closer consumer/student perspective for the final product. Experienced with keeping meeting notes, organizing meetings, and streamlining/delegating work within a group.
- **Beshir:** As a CS major, I have worked on CS projects and have experience in multiple languages and using GitHub. I enjoy these types of projects, which keeps me motivated for the task.
- **Taha:** Have worked in CS-related team projects for website development, familiar with several languages, passionate about CS, good communication, and motivating other members.
